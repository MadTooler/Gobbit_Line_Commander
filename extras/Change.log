0.0.96

	Minor changes...

	Added IR codes to the ScoutBotics level 2 example IRcontrol
	
	Changed QTRtest to be mostly within the library for the purpose of using the local QTRSensor library

0.0.95

	Added ScoutBotics Examples for both Level 1 and Level 2 with IRcontrol.
	
	Updated RaceTrackRobots example to use same default wiring as IRcontrol.
	
	Set PROCESS_TIME to 0 to disable until proper timing default and PIDs can be tested.

0.0.93

	Added PROCESS_TIME define to config.h and a mSampleTime time check in the PID loop to have a more consistent control loop.
	
0.0.92

	Added local copies of QTRSensor library and Adafruit Motor Shield library to eliminate need to load them separate. 
		This is a temporary solution.
		Future solutions will require significant rewrite and probably use Virtual Functions.
	
0.0.90

	Added Ardumoto v14 and v20 and AdafruitMS default pin values in their .h files
	
	Added motor shield select comment at beginning of examples for three different shields

0.0.8

	Created line to disable the internal call for the servo library, functions, and variables, if not needed, or if causing a conflict.
		see in config.h file : #define SERVO_ENABLE TRUE
		
	Added basic auto mode and advanced mode of brakeMotors().  The prior format is no longer.
	
	Added basic auto mode calibrateLineSensor() that does not require an argument.
	
	Removed turnSpeedLow section of calibrateLineSensor so only the calSpeed will be used.

0.0.7
	
	Added video links to QTRtest and MotorDirTest
	
	Added GLC_DriveCompetition example and video link
	
	Added GLC_DetectLine example and video link
	
	Added GLC_FoundTurnFlags example and video link

	Revised move() function to pivot/turn in direction of vector/turn strength value, regardless of forward or reverse velocity.
		Also updated if the vector/turn strength is 100, which will be a spin action without forward/reverse motion, the absolute of the velocity value will be used.


0.0.6

	Change Log Started
	
	Reduced some variables to bytes for conservation of memory.

	Added beep functionality for general use and for target applications.

	Fixed error in intersection detection where it would not time out from detection on large dark surface.

	Created Default tune variables .h files for motor driver and voltage relative values.
		AdafruitMSDefaults.h
		ArdumotoDefaults.h
		
	Created Default config file for other library values.
		config.h
	
	Increased time for intersection detection calculation while driving through before it times out.
		see in config.h file : #define FIND_INTERSECTION_MAXTIME 1000
	
	Created time for marker detection while driving or lineFollow in intersection mode, before it times out with FIND_INTERSECTION_MAXTIME.
		see in config.h file : #define FIND_MARK_TIME	85

	Added routine to extend turn cycle to make sure outer sensor is cleared before centering.  The outer sensors still being over the line appeared to be the issue with the U-turns ('U') sometimens not properly working at full intersections.

	Added brakeMotors().  This stops and momentarily reverses the motors at full power.  Not a true electronic break, and a bit rough on the motors and drivers, but will keep it unless hardware issues occur later.
	
	Added brakeSpeed variable as the threshold speed the motors should be running before enabling motor braking.  
	
	Created time define for braking.
		see in config.h file : #define BRAKING_TIME	30
		
	Added brakeStrength as a percentage of the BRAKING_TIME the motors will be reversed during the brakeMotors() function.  This is used by drive and turn functions.
	
	With better turn sensing, now able to add motor braking at all turns when higher battery voltage and when higher max speeds are called above brakeSpeed value, which makes for much crisper turns, even at higher speeds. The only noticable issue is the back of the robot may hop off the ground when the breaking is really aggressive.

	Moved intersection detection before line follow adjust to try and mitigate "twirks" at intersections.

	Added pastRead value use for followLine when in Drive mode to try to mitigate "twirks" at crossing forward through intersections.  If this results in over oscillation of following during drive mode, it will be disabled in later releases.
	
	followLine() now has four modes:
		followLine(0);  // follow along the line and never exit so it will not do anything else outside of the function
		followLine(1);  // do 1 thing... run through the followLine function one time and make only one motor adjustment then exit
		followLine(2);  // do 2 things... run through the followLine function one time and make only one motor adjustment while checking if an intersection is present then exit
		followLine(3);  // follow along the line until an intersection is found then exit
	
	Cleaned drive() function.
	
	Added readSonarInches() function.  
	
	Made distanceInch value of sonar range reading public.  This will be updated everytime followLine or drive() is used if the setSonar has been called, or if the readSonarInches has been directly called.
	
	Removed use of offCenterSetPoint variable.
	
	Changed void setDriveTurnHighLowStoppoint(int highTurn, int lowTurn, float stopPoint); into two
		void setTurnHighSpeed(int highTurn); 
		void setTurnLowSpeed(int lowTurn); 
	
	Changed turn() to use turnPID() for the end point of turn.  Still rough, and a bit overshoots still with the ardumoto, but overall an improvement requiring less variable tuning.
	
	Added i to setPD -> setPID
		i values in defaults need better test/tune.
	
	Removed setFastPDmultiplier and created 
		setPIDcoarse(p,i,d) for couarse/fast/aggressive settings of P, I, and D.
		setPIDfineRange(0 to 1).
		
	Added detectLine()
	
	Added catchLine()
