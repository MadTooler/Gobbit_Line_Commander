Todo's
 
	Current items todo:
		
	
		Make more efficient to reduce size of library.
		
			Go through functions and determine if any should be removed for space or because not expected to be used.
				
				Evaluate for removal and/or new library or .h/cpp for optional include:
					serialPrintCurrentSettings
					readBatteryVolts
					checkBattery
					
			Go over variable types and usage and reduce memory usage where possible.
				Note some small values that are declared int or float values need to stay that type for math formulas to work properly or for errant values at function calls.
				
			Determine if should use progmem for serial print or not.  the "(F ... )" f macro makes it happen.  Uses very tiny % of progmem vs a ton of ram.
				Serial.print(F("text in here is now stored in progmem instead of ram"))
				
				
		Testing:
		
			Works OK now, but should test and determine if coarse tune variable/defines are best for all motor drivers

			
		Examples
		
			Read through pid tune and revise.  
				Add coarse instructions.
		
		
			Light and Servo Targets
			
			Add Video links to remaining (new videos are needed first).
			
		
		PDF instructions/function manual to be created added to extras folder
			Link to PDF instructions on github and/or website and local to library if possible. 
			**** may only use function list example so easy access and simple copy/paste			


	Later Todo's
	
		Add pictures to github readme

		Turn YR,YL (at y right/left) in drive/turn function

		Refine turnPID.
			Determine if need to override ki
			Determine if using a portion of PV (currently %70) is best method or if formula needs to be adjusted
			**** the current settings seem to be working well, probably leave both as is

		serialPrintCurrentSettings does not show calSpeed unless after calibrateLineSensor(), but it is problematic to get that reading unless robot is actually calibrating on a board.
			Possible improvement on serialPrintCurrentSettings to show calSpeed, but not if have to declare it outside of calibrateLineSensor().
			**** Will leave as is so calibrateLineSensor() follows same format as other motor commands where the speed value is applied with the call of the function.

		Add a destructor for memory free up at exit... ??

		Make loading Adafruit Motor Shield V2 Library conditional, if possible.  
			It may not be possible without requiring maybe the config.h files defines to be modded with an adafruit_ms then add ifdefs.
			Not sure it can be done another way.
			Possibly update examples to have a define at top for both ardumoto and adafruit if can make either conditional in library.

		Determine if should, then make beepCycle a WDT (watch dog timer) or other wakeup timer interrupt and remove all the calls.
			Would be nice, but probably not a good idea since this would be very board specific and have possible conflict issues with other libraries and functions.
			Cleaner beepCycle use or functionality should be developed.
			*****Probably not going to use a timer.  It is not that critical of a function, and it would be nice to keep the timers and interrupts available for other's use in main sketch.

		Improve format for arduino library manager to auto load dependants.
			Current manager does not have capability to load QTRsensors and other libraries if declared as dependants
			Have to wait for newer version.
			
		Barcode reading?  Similar to findMark process, but a bit more challenging.  
			**** probably not since this may be too heavy for the library that is already big.
		
		Maybe make delay optional somehow for gripper open/close calls?		

			
	General House cleaning to do before publishing new releases:
		
		**** delete comments with the **** within, where appropriate.  These are flags for areas needing cleanup or more significant improvement.
		
		Update change log.
			
		Update any changes in keywords.
		
		Confirm all examples do not have any compile errors.
