// Gobbit Line Command Maze Solving example using "Left Hand Rule"
//
//    To see how the turns and line following are being done, look into
//    the GobbitLineCommand.h and .cpp library files.

// If the Adafruit motor shield v2.3 is to be used...
  // M1 and M2 terminals will be used.  Right motor on M1, Left on M2.
  // UnComment the next line if you are using the Adafruit shield
//#define ADAFRUIT_MS 

#include <GobbitLineCommand.h>

GobbitLineCommand MyBot;

// The path variable will store the path that the robot has taken.  It
// is stored as an array of characters, each of which represents the
// turn that should be made at one intersection in the sequence:
//  'L' for left
//  'R' for right
//  'F' for go foward (going straight through an intersection)
//  'B' for making a U-turn and going Back where it came from last
// You should check to make sure that the pathLength of your
// maze design does not exceed the bounds of the array.
char path[100] = "";
unsigned char pathLength = 0; // the length of the path


void setup() {

  // Set your battery voltage for the GLC to load the best default settings
  MyBot.setBatteryVolts(9);

  // Start the GLC with declared and/or default settings
  MyBot.beginGobbit();

  MyBot.calibrateLineSensor();
}

  // Begin maze solving
  MazeSolve();
}


// This function is called once, from the main loop
void MazeSolve()
{
  // Loop until we have solved the maze.
  while (1)
  {
    // Follow line with intersection detection mode
    MyBot.followLine(3);

    // Check if it found the mark at end of maze then exit this while loop
    // NOTE:  If the mark was found, MyBot.foundMark will == 1. Otherwise it will == 0.
    if (MyBot.foundMark) break;

    // If not at the end, we need to determine which turn to make
    // with the left hand rule by sending the intersection results from the GLC followLine(3)
    // function to our selectTurn function.
    // NOTE:  If a left turn possibility was found, MyBot.foundLeft == 1.  Otherwise it will == 0.
    unsigned char dir = selectTurn(MyBot.foundLeft, MyBot.foundForward, MyBot.foundRight);

  // times as you place the robot back to the start.

    //  back on the starting line.
    
    // Stop both motors quickly with motor braking (quick reversal of direction)
    MyBot.brakeMotors(100, 'B');

    // Do nothing while robot is sitting past the end mark on the white of the course, 
    // waiting to be picked up.

    while (!MyBot.detectLine('A'));

    }

    // You must pick up the robot now and bring it back to the start

    // if they all see the line, so let's do nothing while the far Left or Right
    // sensors see the line or open air.

    // Nothing will happen while the robot does not sense the line on any sensor.
